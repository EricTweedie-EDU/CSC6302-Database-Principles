-- Running the Application folder files
All of the folders are within each other, so the View is first, followed by the BLL and then DAL.
This was done due to having an issue with being able to get importing to work properly.

-- The GUI that was used was PySimpleGUI

-- The View.py file is the only file that needs to be run, the BLL and DAL files should open and run as they are called from the View file.
